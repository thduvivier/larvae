This project's goal is to analyse multiple larvae images and return each of their length, finding a good trade-off between computation time and accuracy. 
First, the images are imported and corrected to avoid the hairs and image imperfections to distort the length.
Then, the algorithm is applied to the images. Finally, another algorithm, which has lower computation time is used.
